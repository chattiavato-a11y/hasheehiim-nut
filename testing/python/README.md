# Python testing workspace

Use this sandbox for security scanning, quick scripts, or data analysis utilities that support OPS Online Support.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Suggested tooling:
- **bandit** for static security analysis of Python scripts.
- **requests** for mocking secure integrations or probing API responses.

This directory is optional and can be removed after the testing cycle.
